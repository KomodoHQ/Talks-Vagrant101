Vagrant 101 - After School Sessions
===================================

Here's the After School Session presentation @lhokktyn gave on Vagrant and how we use it at Komodo.

It's built using [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) so you can run through it in the
usual manner by running the following:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/KomodoHQ/Talks-Vagrant101
$ cd Talks-Vagrant101
$ npm install
$ grunt serve
```

Then going to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Or to make life easier, you can just go check it out on
